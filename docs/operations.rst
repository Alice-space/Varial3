Operations on wrapper-types
===========================

In the ``histotools/operation.py`` you will find predefined operations. All of
them take one ore more wrappers and return a wrapper. Every wrapper has a
``history`` member in which all applied operations are stored.

All operations are present in the form of a generator in the generator
module.
